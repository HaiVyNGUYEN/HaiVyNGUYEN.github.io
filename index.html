<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. under a <strong>CIFRE contract with Renault Group</strong>, starting from <strong>November 15, 2022</strong>. 
  My academic affiliation is with <strong>IMT Toulouse</strong> and <strong>IRIT Toulouse</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  My Ph.D. is carried out under the academic supervision of 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wK29Q6IAAAAJ&hl=fr" target="_blank">Fabrice Gamboa</a> (thesis director), 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q9HdQc4AAAAJ&hl=fr" target="_blank">Serge Gratton</a> (thesis co-director), 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-cL9xWMAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Sixin Zhang</a>, and 
  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AjaQakcAAAAJ&hl=fr" target="_blank">Reda Chhaibi</a> (co-supervisors).
</p>

<p>
  My research interests lie at the intersection of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>, 
  with a particular focus on leveraging <em>mathematical tools to enhance AI models</em>. 
  I am especially passionate about working on projects with <em>clear, well-defined goals</em>, where theory meets practical impact.
</p>

<p>
  Some of my current research directions include:
  <ul>
    <li>Quantifying <strong>uncertainty in neural network predictions</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge distillation</strong> through <em>feature representation transfer</em></li>
    <li>Enhancing the <strong>robustness of neural models</strong> to perturbations and domain shifts</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  I am also deeply curious about the structure of <strong>feature spaces in neural networks</strong>, and I consider it a long-term research goal to better understand their <em>local and global dimensionality</em> as well as <em>topological structures</em>. 
  I believe that this line of inquiry is essential to uncovering and explaining the underlying behaviors of modern AI models — including both vision and language systems.

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ph.D. CIFRE – Data Scientist (2022 – present)</strong>  
    <br>
    <em>Renault Group (CIFRE contract), IMT Toulouse & IRIT Toulouse</em>
    <br>
    Working closely with engineers at Renault to develop innovative AI solutions as part of a CIFRE research project. My focus includes uncertainty quantification, feature-based knowledge distillation, and robustness of neural networks.

  <li>
    <strong>Apprentice Data Scientist (Oct 2021 – Sep 2022)</strong>  
    <br>
    <em>CLS (Collecte Localisation Satellites Group), Ramonville – France</em>
    <br>
    • Built LSTM-autoencoder models for unsupervised clustering of variable-length animal trajectories in a latent space.  
    • Developed a novel unsupervised algorithm, <strong>DBSCAN-temporel</strong>, inspired by DBSCAN but adapted to temporal and spatial constraints.
    • Designed visualizations to make movement data accessible to non-experts.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Machine Learning Intern (Jun 2021 – Sep 2021)</strong>  
    <br>
    <em>CNRS, Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées – Toulouse, France</em>
    <br>
    • Applied deep learning for seismic image segmentation to extract dispersion curves and reconstruct subsurface structures.  
    • Generated synthetic training data by synchronizing two geophysical simulation programs (SPECFEM2D and CPS).  
    • Developed the first method for automatic labeling in this context, reducing manual annotation cost.  
    • Used DCNet (dual U-Net architecture) to improve model robustness.
